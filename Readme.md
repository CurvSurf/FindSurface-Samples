**Curv*Surf* FindSurface™ SDK** Samples

Overview
--------

**Curv*Surf* FindSurface™ SDK** is a dimensional (3D) point cloud processing library.

The SDK allows the development of solutions for automated 3D geometry recognizing, measuring, and tracking applications. The library allows a user to detect geometry features such as Plane, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, and Torus as well as their geometric parameters (position, orientation, size, radius, volume, and etc.).

The samples listed below are designed to demonstrate how to develop an application by using our FindSurface SDK.
