Overview
--------

**Curv*Surf* FindSurface™ SDK** is a dimensional (3D) point cloud processing library.

The SDK allows the development of solutions for automated 3D geometry recognition, measurement and tracking applications. The library supports geometric feature detection such as Plane, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, and Torus with geometric parameters (position, orientation, size, radius, volume, and etc.).

The samples are designed to show examples of how to develop an application using the SDK.
