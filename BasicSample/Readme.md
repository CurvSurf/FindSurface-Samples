# FindSurface-Samples / BasicSample / Readme.md
**Curv*Surf* FindSurfaceâ„¢ SDK** Samples - BasicSample

Overview
--------

This sample source code presents the simplest usage of FindSurface SDK.

The sample program reads sample.xyz file and automatically finds primitives around pre-defined positions.

**The sample only runs with our FindSurface SDK library files (FindSurface.dll, etc.).**

**You must either [request a free trial](http://developers.curvsurf.com/licenses.jsp) or [purchase a license](https://developers.curvsurf.com/licenses.jsp) to activate the library files.**


Quick Start
