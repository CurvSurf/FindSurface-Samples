# FindSurface-Samples / SimpleGUI / Readme.md
**Curv*Surf* FindSurfaceâ„¢ SDK** Samples - SimpleGUI

Overview
--------

This sample code provides an example of GUI application, which it benefits users to interact and manipulate the application.

The sample code is for Windows and Linux environments.

The sample program will allow users to obtain the following data:

once a user clicks a surface on a rendered point cloud, then the program detects **the parametric model** of the surface.

**The sample program only runs with our FindSurface SDK library files (FindSurface.dll, etc.).**

**You must either [request a free trial](http://developers.curvsurf.com/licenses.jsp) or [purchase a license](https://developers.curvsurf.com/licenses.jsp) to activate the library files.**


Quick Start
------------

Once you build the sample code, a demo program will be made and it requires the following command arguments:
	
  - accuracy
  - mean-distance
  - touch-radius-step
  - point-cloud-filename

"Accuracy" and "Mean-distance" are the parameters of FindSurface. See "C APIs" > Enumerations > Parameter at [here](https://developers.curvsurf.com/documentation.jsp) for more details.

"Touch-radius-step" is a step value of when you change touch radius. 

"Point-cloud-filename" is the file to load in the program.

Look at the details below and you will be able to assign these arguments and run the program:

	usage: SimpleGUI.exe [options <option-value>] [point-cloud-filename]
		options:
			-a 		accuracy (the default value is 0.003, which represents 3 mm)
			-d 		mean distance (the default value is 0.01, which represents 10 mm)
			-s 		touch radius step (the default value is 0.01, which represents 10 mm)

		point-cloud-filename:
			<filename.xyz> 		it will try to find "sample.xyz", if omitted.

	example 1: SimpleGUI.exe -a 0.002 -s 0.02 -d 0.1 

The example 1 means that the program sets accuracy to 2 mm, mean distance to 100 mm, touch radius step to 20 mm respectively. There are two options which the program will cause a failure:

1. If a filename is given, the program will search for the file, but if it does not exist, the program will result in a failure.

2. If a filename is not given, the program will search for the default file "sample.xyz", but if it does not exist, then the program will result in a failure.
